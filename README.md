# DatatubeV2
A shiny app for visualizing differential expression data from *H. glaberrima* contigs. 

This version of Datatube_Heatmap has the following new features:

* generates a heatmap using a ranked list of differential expression data
* allows for exporting the heatmap in .tiff file format

The shinyApp can be accessed via the shinyapp server [here](https://josefinacmenendez.shinyapps.io/datatubev2/).

To access the data, please refer to the following manuscript:
